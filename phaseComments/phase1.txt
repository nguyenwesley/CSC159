a compiler warning, when running, seconds are shown on incorrect columns,
and spaces become 0000

Clock
   >=0 is one too many, should be >0, but use i++ for forward display,
   going backward (i--) from 75 will show on incorrect columns

numToString
   recode, must know how to use a loop

stringCounter
   array index starts from 0, not 1, so return's incorrect (misses by 1)

boot.c
  x shouldn't be global

CreateProc
   (q_t*) is not needed since &ready_q _is_ that type
   (char *) is not needed since &stack[... _is_ that type

main
   (q_t*) is not needed since &ready_q _is_ that type

Bzero
   advance the addr: memoryStart++, not what's pointed: *memoryStart++
   samething with func_p_t, no *

TimerService
   samething like above
   state changed to wrong state

QisEmpty
   check size, not tail (potentially fatal)
   use name of constant, not 20

DeQ
   incorrect, recode:
   return pid is in q[] where head points to, decr size, advance head (may wrap)

EnQ
   incorrect, recode:
   add pid to q[] where tail points to, incr size, advance tail (may wrap)

Bzero
   > 0, not >=0 (that will have one extra byte too many, potentially fatal)
   advance pointer memoryStart, not the content it points to (no *)
